# Flight Tracking API

## Introduction

Welcome to my first personal coding project ! :airplane: This API is designed to retrieve live flight tracking data and serve it to a [React](https://react.dev) front-end with the goal of building a functional clone of one of my favorite apps : [FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com). I've always been passionate about aviation, so creating my own flight tracking app from scratch has been an exciting challenge and a fantastic learning experience. You can check out the React front-end repository [here](https://github.com/thomasmercuriot/react-flight-radar).

I started this project to teach myself the basics of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), and it’s been a rewarding journey — combining my passion for aviation with learning to code ! Although I’m not planning to actively maintain this repository for now, I’m very open to feedback[^1] and contributions — I'd love to hear from others and continue improving this project as I grow as a developer. With time and experience, I hope to revisit this project and turn this into a polished flight tracking app I can use while plane spotting[^2] !

Thanks for checking out my project, and happy coding ! :rocket:
